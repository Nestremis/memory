 #Memory game
Single page application made in REACT REDUX.

Memory game: write down in input "word=translation" and press enter, for example "dog=pies" and press "enter"... it will generate 2 cards; repeat for next cards (maximum 24 cards). 

Buttons allow you to either delete a given deck or repeat it with a new random selection.
